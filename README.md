Heidi is program that can determine, for some hypergraphs, whether the hypertree width equals two.  It was written as a very minimalistic entry to exact hypertree decomposition track of the 2019 [PACE Challenge.](https://pacechallenge.org/).

*This solver, in its current form, is unlikely to be of practical use.*

To run:
```
python solve.py < instance.hgr
```
